The readme file provided in this [link](https://github.com/mpdmanash/thermal_photometric_calibration/blob/master/README.md) contains the instructions on how to build and run our code on a demo dataset. This article mainly focuses on the following questions:
 - The algorithm: How it works and what should you expect?
 - The C++ implementation: Where and how is the algorithm implemented in the code?
 - How can you use it in your project or dataset?
